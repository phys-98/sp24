Course description: This course will act as an adjunct course for Physics 5A, focused on physics
problem-solving skills and covering mathematical topics important in physics. This class will also

provide content review and support, introduce study strategies, and allow students to build a com-
munity of peers in physics.

Enrollment criteria: This course is intended for students concurrently enrolled in Physics 5A.
Students concurrently enrolled in Physics 7A who desire practice solving additional problems at a
higher level of difficulty are also welcome, but please note that the scope of material covered is not
aligned with the 7-series curriculum. Please feel free to email us if you want to know more.

2 What is this class, and why should I take it?
Learning Outcomes
Tackling hard problems in physics
Physics is centered around a few core principles which come up again and again in different
contexts. This course aims to help you build up a toolbox of techniques for approaching hard
problems. You’ll develop general problem solving strategies, learn specific mathematical tools, and
practice applying these skills to new situations. Most importantly, you’ll gain exposure to a variety
of problems (and how to solve them), which you will be able to draw upon as a reference when
faced with new problems in your later classes.
We’ll be focusing on learning physics by doing problems purposefully: building our way up to
involved problems from core principles, and reflecting on what we can learn from each mistake,
approach, and solution. The in-class worksheets will often introduce new ideas in this way, in order
to guide you through the material and let you explore the underlying connections. By practicing
physics with intent, you’ll gain as much as possible from each problem.
Learning how to study
Another major goal of this course is to help you learn how to study for physics. College-level
physics at Berkeley is hard, and likely very different from what you might have experienced in high
school. We will talk about study strategies that have worked for us and our peers and provide a
space for you to discover how you learn best. We are also big advocates for collaboration! It’s tough
(and often, impossible) to go through physics alone, and we’ll encourage and facilitate community
building within your cohort.
Connecting the dots
Finally, we want to help connect this class into the broader framework of physics. Sometimes,
you may wonder how the different topics in mechanics fit together, or how they’re relevant in future
classes. To help with this, we will highlight the key topics in the class that will show up again and
again in your physics career. We will also discuss the underlying structure to topics and alternate
approaches to understanding them that are often dismissed from introductory physics classes.
After this course, you should be able to...
• Break down a complicated problem to understand what it is asking and come up with several
potential processes to solve it
• Check the accuracy of your solutions to problems and understand what a solution should look
like before solving for it
• Use your intuitive physical understanding in conjunction with your mathematical knowledge
to interpret and solve physics problems

• Understand how the topics of Physics 5A connect to your future coursework and the underly-
ing structure of physics

2 of 9

• Implement a set of study strategies for physics that work for you
• Utilize academic resources (such as the textbook, office hours, lecture, online references,
peers, Mathematica/Python, etc.) to effectively learn new material
We hope that, by the end of this course, you’ll feel more confident using a variety of techniques
for approaching difficult problems, and that you’ll have formed a community of peers within your
cohort you feel comfortable collaborating and learning with!
Respect Policy
Expectations for your instructors:
• We will come prepared to class to help you understand the course material and we will return
your grades in a timely fashion.
• We will always make sure that you feel like you belong in physics – because you do! We
know that physics is traditionally dominated by men, especially white men, and we want
to create a learning environment welcoming to all students. We will respect your diverse
identities and backgrounds (including professional goals, race/ethnicity, nationality, gender
identity, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, language, religion, ability, etc). If something
is said in class that makes you uncomfortable, please let us know by filling out the Anonymous
Feedback Form, directly contacting one of us, or filling out the department’s Student Climate
and Incident Reporting Form. Relatedly, we believe in the Physics Department Community
Principles. See also some of the resources in Section 5 of this syllabus.
• We are here to help and support you in your transition to Berkeley Physics. Please feel free
to come to our office hours, email us, or schedule an appointment if you ever want to meet
with us.
• We will take your feedback seriously. If there is something that you would like us to do
differently, please let us know by using our Anonymous Feedback Form, sending us an email,
coming to office hours, or scheduling an appointment!
• We are also here to help if you have issues with Physics 5A. If you find the class environment
uncomfortable, or if you feel there are issues with the class, please talk to us – we can discuss
your concerns with the professor and help advocate for you.
Expectations for students:
• We believe there is no such thing as a dumb question. We encourage you to ask questions,
encourage each other to ask questions, and support each other. We want to foster a space in
which you and your fellow classmates feel safe making mistakes and being wrong.
• We will not use, and strongly encourage you not to use, words like trivial, obvious or easy
when referring to problems or methods of solving them. Often, there is a lot going on behind
the scenes in seemingly simple problems!
• We expect you to be proactive about making other students feel included and respected.
Learn your classmates’ names and pronouns, invite them to work with you, and help each
other learn.
• We ask that you communicate with us if you need extensions, assistance, or accommodations
while taking this class. We are here to look out for you!

3 What do I need to do for this class, and why?
Class Attendance and Participation

Your learning in this class depends on being exposed to many different points of view, collab-
orating with your peers, and having an opportunity to actively engage with the material. For this

reason, attendance is the most important component of this course, and we highly encourage you
to attend in person as much as possible.
That said, we understand life happens; to make up for attendance if you miss class, you are

expected to watch the posted recording(s) and submit your work for the worksheet problems cov-
ered in class via Gradescope by the end of the week. (Note: students will not be recorded during

class.) We encourage you to do your best to keep up with the material, as topics build on each other
rapidly. The same grading, collaboration, and corrections policies apply to the makeup problems as
to the regular weekly problems.
If this class has a time conflict with your schedule but you would still like to take it, we ask
that you let us know in advance so we can arrange a compromise.
Weekly Problems & Corrections

There will be a mechanics problem assigned each week, which draws from that week’s mate-
rial. This will be due at the beginning of class the following week. The purpose of this assignment

is to provide you an opportunity to test how much you can do on your own. These assignments
should serve as a "benchmark" for you to check your learning throughout the semester. For this reason,
the weekly problem should be done without using the internet, your notes, or discussing with peers.

The problem will be graded on correctness – you will receive 0 points for unattempted ques-
tions, 0.3 points for a reasonable attempt, and 1 point for a correct solution. You will always have

the opportunity to do corrections on your problems to regain full points. When doing correc-
tions, feel free to discuss the problems with your peers and/or ask for help from instructors during

office hours. However, the final write up of the solution should be your own. This homework is
designed for you to identify and learn from your mistakes.
Beginning of Semester & Post-Exam Reflections
These reflections are a short write up in response to a prompt. We ask you to complete these
reflections for two main reasons. The first is to help us fine tune the course to fit your needs –
students come into the 5 series with vastly different backgrounds in physics and math, and diverse
goals for what they want to get out of the class. In the spirit of intentional practice, the second
reason is to give you a chance to reflect on the effectiveness of your past studying methods, and
consider how you can adjust your approach for the future.
It’s very easy to get caught up in the grind of classes and bounce from one exam to the next like
a very stressed pinball. The purpose of these assignments is to give you the chance to contemplate
your progress (and, well, reflect) so that you can venture forth with purpose and a plan.

Pre-Exam Reviews
Before each midterm and the final, we will release a review packet of problems which target
key concepts. We will do many of these problems in class. From the remaining problems, you may
select those you believe will most benefit your studying to do as homework.
Unlike the regular homework assignments, we highly encourage you to discuss these problems
with your peers, and/or bring them to office hours. As always, the final write up of the solution
should be your own.
Enrichment Project
In the spirit of the excitement of discovering new things and exploring the deeper structure of

physics, the final assignment of this course will be an enrichment project. You will choose an in-
teresting problem that goes beyond a "textbook-style" problem to explore, and either present your

solution or write it up. More details about what this will look like will be released later in the
semester. This project will be due by the end of the last week of classes.
Late Work and Extensions
If you need an extension on an assignment, please fill out this form to request a different due
date as soon as possible. In general, these requests will be granted as long as you let us know more
than 24 hours in advance of the deadline. Please let us know what you need. We can’t help you if we
aren’t aware of your circumstances.
Assignments you submit late without letting us know in advance will generally not receive full
credit. How much credit late work will receive depends on how promptly you communicate with
us and turn it in, and how much value there is in completing that assignment late.
If you feel you are falling behind in this class or in Physics 5A, please schedule a meeting
with us as soon as possible. We will do our best to catch you up and adjust the requirements to fit
your needs.
Grading
The course grade is determined by the following components:
Attendance 30%
Weekly Problems 30%
Reflections 10%
Midterm and Final Reviews 15%
Enrichment Project 15%

This class is graded Pass/No Pass. To pass you must obtain at least 70% of the possible points.
You must also turn in the reflections, reviews, and enrichment project to pass.
